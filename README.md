# Oncue Coding Challenge

An MVP solution to automating scheduling client jobs for moving companies.

[Give it a try.](https://oncue-mvp.herokuapp.com/)

Find my (minimal) app plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6f221wNPLa2bSQVG2loMHuqiIpd0YrZiS-bfsZsigs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Tech: React, Node.js, Express, and Postgres
Honorable Mentions: Sequelize, Axios, and Babel

## Possible Next Features and Trade-offs:
- (Feat) Time slot suggestions
- (Fix) Remove alerts, use subtle modal pop-ups instead
- (Feat) Calendar View
- (Trade-off) Job scheduling conflict detection requires 3 database queries. More advanced queries could improve response latency.
- (Problem) App does not account for time between jobs, breaks, etc.
- (Feat) Automate removing completed jobs.
- ...A ton of other cool features and fixes.
